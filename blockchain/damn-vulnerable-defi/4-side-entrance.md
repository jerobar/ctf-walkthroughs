# 4 - Side Entrance

### Hints

<details>

<summary>Hint One</summary>

You will need to deploy your own smart contract to solve this challenge.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint Two</summary>

This is a re-entrancy exploit.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint Three</summary>

The two `require` statements in `flashLoan` check the balance of the pool contract address is not less than it was before calling your contractâ€™s `execute` function. This means that whatever exploit logic your `execute` function implements, it cannot decrement this balance. What else could it do?
