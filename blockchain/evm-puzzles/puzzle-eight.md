# Puzzle Eight

Enter the calldata.

### Hints

<details>

<summary>Hint One</summary>

You need the `EQ` operation at step `0x16` to evaluate to true, which means the result of the `CALL` at `0x13` is equal to the `0x00` pushed by step `0x14`. `CALL` will return 0 if and only if the contract being called reverts. The bytecode from the previous puzzle can almost be used to solve this level, you will just need to tweak it slightlyâ€¦

<summary>Hint Two</summary>

The REVERT opcode is `0xFD`.&#x20;

```

### Solution

We need the `EQ` operation at 16 to evaluate as true, which means we need the result of the `CALL` at 13 to equal the `00` pushed by 14. `CALL` will return `0` if and only if the contract being called reverts.

The first 10 steps deploy the contract initialization code we supply as the calldata. We only want this code to revert (opcode `FD`), so we can use the following payload:

`0x60FD6000526001601ff3`

This code is similar to the previous solution, with only the second byte changed from an `01` to the REVERT opcode `FD`. This will deploy a contract that reverts when it is called.
