# 16 - Preservation

### Hints

<details>

<summary>Hint One</summary>

The `Preservation` contract uses `delegatecall` to execute functions on the `LibraryContract`. When the `LibraryContract` executes an expression to update a state variable, on which contract is this state variable updated?

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint Two</summary>

The `LibraryContract` only contains one state variable, as opposed to the \`Preservation\` contractâ€™s five state variables. What does this mean in terms of which memory slots the `LibraryContract` may update on the calling contract?

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint Three</summary>

As the `LibraryContract` can only update the first storage slot of `Preservation`, this contract will not grant you sufficient leverage to update the `owner` variable on its own. Right idea, wrong storage slot being updated.

</details>
