# Bandit - Level 1

To complete [level one](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html), we need to read the contents of a file called `-` located in the home directory. Connect to the host **bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org** using the flag found in the previous level as the password.
